Once you have OptimumDynamics installed and your license applied you are ready to start using the software.  The following section describes how to get up and running with a new OptimumDynamics project.

#Launching OptimumDynamics

The first step is launching the application. After successful installation you can find the OptimumDynamics executable program in your computer start menu or as an icon on your desktop. OptimumDynamics requires administrator privileges to run. 

#Creating a New Project

The first time OptimumDynamics is used a new project must be created or alternately an existing project can be loaded. 

1.	On the File tab, click New
2.	Select New Project
3.	You should give the project a relevant Filename and select a Location to save it
4.	Click Save

Upon creating a new project, a folder will be created on your hard drive in the selected directory. All the files related to your project will be saved in this project folder. OptimumDynamics separates the project into individual components, this makes importing and exporting between projects much easier.
