#Detailed Guide	

Now that you have started and have been introduced to the software it is time to start building your project. This guide covers the detailed information necessary to achieve this. The main three processes involved with an OptimumDynamics project are. 

1. [Understanding Vehicle Design]("1 Understanding Vehicle Design.md")
2. Simulation
3. Analysis

The usual process followed is to begin defining the vehicle you want to investigate. The more accurate and complete the component definitions are the better. After this you will decide what types of simulations need to be conducted and finally the results of these simulations can be analyzed in different reporting formats.
